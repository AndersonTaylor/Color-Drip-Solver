Color Drip is a game from ____________ for mobile devices.

The hard levels are pretty hard to complete, so I created 
this brute force solver to show my friend that I could beat 
ot (with computer aid).

The program takes in a list of lists representing the starting gameboard and chooses what 
block to press randomly (like a person pokin the screen blindly)  It continues this untill it 
gets stuck or wins.  If it doesn't win, it just starts the process over.  

(obviously this is a very inefficient search, but it usually finds the solution in a few min, 
which may be good enough)
